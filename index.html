          Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters
          in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in
          Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small.
          After hiring the Stanford Research Institute to perform a feasability study determining an appropriate site
          for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. The park was designed by a
          creative team hand-picked by Walt from internal and outside talent. They founded WED Enterprises, the
          precursor to today's Walt Disney Imagineering. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a
          special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.

          Since opening, Disneyland has undergone expansions and major renovations, including the addition of New
          Orleans Square in 1966, Bear Country in 1972, Mickey's Toontown in 1993, and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge in
          2019.[2] Opened in 2001, Disney California Adventure Park was built on the site of Disneyland's original
          parking lot.

          Disneyland has a larger cumulative attendance than any other theme park in the world, with 726 million visits
          since it opened (as of December 2018). In 2018, the park had approximately 18.6 million visits, making it the
          second most visited amusement park in the world that year, behind only Magic Kingdom, the very park it
          inspired.[3] According to a 2005 Disney report, 65,700 jobs are supported by the Disneyland Resort, including
          about 20,000 direct Disney employees and 3,800 third-party employees (independent contractors or their
          employees).[4] Disney announced "Project Stardust" in 2019, which included major structural renovations to the
          park to account for higher attendance numbers.[5]

          The United States Federal Aviation Administration has declared a zone of prohibited airspace around both
          Disneyland and some of the surrounding areas at Sleeping Beauty Castle. No aircraft, including recreational
          and commercial drones, are permitted to fly within this zone; this level is only shared with Walt Disney
          World, other pieces of critical infrastructure (military bases, Pantex) in the United States and whenever the
          President of the United States travels outside of Washington, D.C.[6]

      <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the
        story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron,
        Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel
        superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head
        dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The
        movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the
        universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

      <p>After failing to capture Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker) for the Anti-Villain League, Gru (Steve Carell) and
        Lucy (Kristen Wiig) find themselves unemployed, wondering what the future holds for their family. When little
        Agnes (Nev Scharrel) starts selling her toys to neighborhood kids to help supplement the family income, Gru,
        like any good parent, lets her know that everything will be fine. Meanwhile, the Minions, fed up with Gru’s
        continued good behavior, go on strike and pretty much leave the movie’s main story for their own insignificant
        side plot.



        When word comes that Gru has a twin brother he never knew, the family packs up to meet Dru (also voiced by
        Steve Carell). Dru has done well for himself and Gru’s clan takes in Dru’s extravagant home with wide eyes.
        But Dru feels unfulfilled in that he never followed in his Dad’s villainous footsteps so he asks Gru to teach
        him how to be a villain. Gru needs the huge diamond stolen by Bratt in order to get his job back. So Gru and
        Dru set about stealing the diamond from Bratt.



        Despicable Me 3 will have the kids laughing out loud at the crazy antics of Gru and Dru. Parents might well
        shake their heads, especially at Bratt, a washed-up child actor stuck in the ‘80’s, complete with shoulder
        pads, hi-tops, and mullet. There are too many story lines going on at the same time to make a cohesive film.
        There’s Gru and Dru doing one thing, the Minions doing another, Lucy trying her best to be a good mom to her
        new stepdaughters, and Agnes’s quest for a live unicorn.



        Even though the story is fairly convoluted, it’s worth taking your kids to see. There are laughs abounding,
        even a version of the Pirates of Penzance song, “I am the Very Model of a Modern Major General.” And just as
        you conclude that the story has no more possibilities, the ending sets up a possible sequel. Even with all its
        imperfections, Despicable Me 3 is worth the watch as Gru and his ever-growing family try to sort out their new
        relationships and encounter all the funny things that go along with loving family members even with all their
        quirks.
